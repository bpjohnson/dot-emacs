#+Title: Bryan's .emacs Stuff

This is a work in progress. At the moment it's missing configs for org-mode, projectile, multiple-cursors, and a bunch of other stuff.

Also, it's poorly organized and commented. So enjoy!

A few of the libraries have external dependencies. Those are:

 - https://github.com/NicolasPetton/xref-js2
 - http://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html (expected to be installed in .emacs.d/tern )
